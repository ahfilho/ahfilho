I have more proximity to Java, which was used in most of the things I participated in.
 

Tools I use: Eclipse, VSCODE, Spring tolls, the good old xampp, workbench and the postman for testing with REST API.

In addition to this basic knowledge with programming, I have a good knowledge of hardware / software, since I do some work with PC maintenance and the like.
